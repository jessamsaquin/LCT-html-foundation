    <h1>Understanding Web Frameworks</h1>
    <p>By Jessa Montes Saquin</p>
    <article>
      <p>
        A <strong>web framework</strong> (WF)
        <strong>or web application framework</strong>
        (WAF) is a software framework designed to support the development of web
        applications, including web services, web resources, and web APIs.
        <br /><br />
        Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common
        activities performed in web development. For example, many web
        frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks,
        and session management, and they often promote code reuse. Although they
        often target development of dynamic web sites, they are also applicable
        to static websites
      </p>

      <h3>Types of Web Frameworks</h3>
      <p>
        Web frameworks can be broadly categorized into
        <strong>frontend</strong> and <strong>backend</strong> frameworks.
      </p>
      <h3>Frontend Frameworks</h3>
      <p>
        Front-end frameworks focus on the user interface and user experience
        aspects of web development. They enable developers to create interactive
        and responsive interfaces that run in the user's browser.
        <br /><br />
        Some popular frontend frameworks include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>React</strong>: A JavaScript library for building user
          interfaces, maintained by Facebook. It allows developers to create
          reusable UI components.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Angular</strong>: A TypeScript-based front-end framework
          developed and maintained by Google. It provides a comprehensive
          solution for building dynamic single-page applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vue.js</strong>: A progressive JavaScript framework that is
          approachable yet powerful, making it easy to integrate with other
          libraries or existing projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ember.js</strong>: A client-side JavaScript web application
          framework based on the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern. It
          supports two-way data binding, computed properties, and uses
          Handlebars.js for templating.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Svelte</strong>: A framework for building user interfaces that
          compiles Svelte code to JavaScript DOM manipulations, allowing for
          simpler application development without needing to bundle a framework
          to the client.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Backend Frameworks</h3>
      <p>
        Backend frameworks handle the server-side operations, database
        interactions, and application logic. They provide the foundation for
        building robust and scalable server-side applications.
        <br /><br />
        Some popular backend frameworks include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Django</strong>: A high-level Python web framework that
          encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>: A server-side web application
          framework written in Ruby. It follows the model-view-controller (MVC)
          pattern and provides default structures for databases, web services,
          and web pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Express.js</strong>: A minimal and flexible Node.js web
          application framework that provides a robust set of features for
          building web and mobile applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spring</strong>: A comprehensive framework for enterprise Java
          development, offering features such as dependency injection,
          transaction management, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Laravel</strong>: A PHP framework known for its elegant syntax
          and rich set of features like routing, authentication, and caching.
        </li>
      </ul>
