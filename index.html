			<h2>HTML - The Foundation of the Web</h2>
				<p>Posted by <strong>Jessa Montes Saquin</strong></p>

				<strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is the most basic building block of the Web. 
                It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used 
                to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).	
			    <br><br>
            
				"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website 
                or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet 
                and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
			
            <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
			
				HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. 
                It is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which 
                you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. 
                The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font 
                bigger or smaller, and so on.
            <br><br>
            
				HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, 
                etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.

			<p>The Main Parts of Elements are as Follows</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The opening tag</li>
					<li>The closing tag</li>
					<li>The content </li>
					<li>The element</li>
				</ol>
